# MapboxAndroidDemo

This is a public demo of the Mapbox Android SDK that's [available now in the Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mapbox.mapboxandroiddemo).
We use this to test out changes and collect user feedback and bug reports.

## Building

* Change the `versionCode` in `build.gradle`
* Run `./MapboxAndroidDemo/release.sh` to generate a new release, which will be in `build/MapBoxAndroidDemo-release.apk`

## Usage with IntelliJ

After tweaking your `build.gradle` file, start a new IntelliJ project by importing
`./build.gradle`.
